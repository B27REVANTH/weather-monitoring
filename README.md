# weather-monitoring
This is an Raspberry Pi Based project which gives us information about climatic changes that are going to take
place by which man can be aware of present and for future climatic changes.  Most of the weather reporting applications extracts the data from accurate weather system. Here we are building our own weather reporting system which would give us information about present temperature, humidity etc. We can setup this in our home and get time 
to time changes in climate which would help us in planning our daily work easily. Like It would 
be helpful for a farmer in this agricultural activity by which he can protect his crops climatic 
changes. It would help in transportation giving information of weather conditions etc.
